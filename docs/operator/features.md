title: Feature Flags

<!-- Use this template to provide technical details about configuration of a Kyma chart or sub-chart.

For the filename, follow the `{COMPONENT/AREA}-{NUMBER}-{TITLE}.md` convention.
Make sure that the configuration document for the main chart displays first on the list.

For reference, see the existing [**Configuration** documents](https://kyma-project.io/#/05-technical-reference/00-configuration-parameters/README).-->

To configure the {Component name} {sub-}chart, override the default values of its `defaultConfig.yaml` file.

<!-- Use the tip feature to provide links to the documentation about Kyma configuration. Also add a link to examples of either top-level charts overrides for charts configuration documents or sub-charts overrides for sub-chart configuration documents.-->

## Features priority

Initialisation of the Busola features is based on the `stage` property, which can take one of the following values:

- `PRIMARY` - the feature is resolved while the application bootstraps. Features that should be immediately visible must be set as `PRIMARY` (for example, main navigation structure).
- `SECONDARY` - the feature is resolved after the application is ready, it must be used for non-critical features (for example, additional navigation nodes).

If the stage is not set, the feature is loaded only on demand, most often by the iframe. Use the `useFeature` hook to request usage of such a feature.

> [!NOTE]
> Some features must be run before the application starts the bootstrap process, so they are out of the normal feature flow.

## Configurable Flags for Frontend

> **TIP:** The list is ordered alphabetically.

This table lists the frontend configurable feature flags, their descriptions, and default values:

| Feature flag                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Description | Default value                                                                                                           |

| **KUBECONFIG_ID**                   | Configures the URL to which Busola sends a request to download a kubeconfig file. If you add `?kubeconfigID={your ID}` to the Busola URL, Busola tries to download the kubeconfig from `{kubeconfigUrl}/{yourID}`. If the operation succeeds, Busola adds the kubeconfing file to the cluster. If you use a full address in the **kubeconfigUrl** field, Busola also reads it. **showClustersOverview** - optional configuration to instruct Busola to show **Clusters Overview** rather than the current context cluster, after the clusters are loaded. **defaultKubeconfig** - define the optional default **KUBECONFIG_ID** to load this kubeconfig when you visit Busola homepage `/` and there are no memorized clusters in the application. | `true`                                                                                                                  |
| **LEGAL_LINKS**                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Shows or hides legal links. In **config**, you can find the unchangeable keys (you cannot use **legalDisclosure** instead of **legal-disclosure**). The keys include both the default link, which takes you to the default address, and a link that depends on your chosen language. The link under the given key is selected based on your language code (de, en, pl, etc.). If the code is not available, the default link is used. | [LEGAL_LINKS default config example](https://github.com/kyma-project/busola/blob/main/public/defaultConfig.yaml#L4)     |
| **PROTECTED_RESOURCES**             |                       Blocks the edit and delete functions based on the determined rules. If the resource meets the rule requirements, the resource becomes protected and cannot be edited/deleted. Each resource requires the **match** field, which includes a list of key-value pairs. The proper rule description is when the definition given in the key matches the value. To switch comparison mode from **standard** to **regex**, set the **regex** parameter to `true`. Optionally, you can provide the **message** parameter, which displays a simple message, or **messageSrc**, which is a YAML path where the message to be displayed is included. If neither **message** nor **messageSrc** is provided, a generic message is used. | `true`                                                                                                                  |
