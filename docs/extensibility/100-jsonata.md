# Use JSONata Expressions with Resource-Based Extensions

[JSONata](https://docs.jsonata.org/overview.html) is a user-friendly language (inspired by XPath 3.1) designed for querying and transforming JSON data. JSONata includes a variety of built-in operators and functions for manipulating data. You can format the results into any JSON structure you need, and create your own functions to handle complex tasks.

JSONata comes with Kyma dashboard, so you don't need to install any additional components.

## Scoping

The primary data source of JSONata expressions changes depending on where it's used. Starting with the root, it contains the whole resource, but whenever it's in a child whose parent has a **source** (in lists and details) or **path** (in forms) parameter, the scope changes to data from that source or path.

Additionally, the scope in arrays changes to the array item.

For example, for this resource:

```yaml
spec:
  name: foo
  description: bar
  items:
    - name: item-name
      details:
        status: ok
```

The following definition has their scope changed as follows:

```yaml
- source: spec.name # top level, scope is the same as a resource

- source: spec # top level, scope is the same as a resource
  children:
    - source: name # parent has source=spec, therefore this refers to spec.name

- children:
    - source: spec.name # As there's no parent source here, the scope is still the resource

- source: spec.items
  children:
    - source: name # parent data is an array, therefore scope changes to its item - this refers to spec.items[0].name
    - source: details.status # refers to spec.items[0].details.status (same as above)
    - source: details # this changes scope for its children again
      children:
        source: status # this refers to spec.items[0].details.status
```

## Common Variables

Common variables are the primary means to bypass the default scoping.

- **\$root** - always contains the reference to the resource, so any JSONata in the example above can always be `$root.spec.name`.
- **\$item** - refers to the most recent array item. When not in an array, it's equal to **\$root**.
- **\$items** - contains an array of references to all parent array items (with the last item being equal to **\$item**).
- **\$value** - when used in a JSONata other than **source** (for example **visibility**, but also other widget-specific formulas), contains the value returned by the source.
- **\$index** - exists in array components, refers to the index of the current item of an array.

### Example

```yaml
- widget: Table
  source: spec.rules
  visibility: $exists($value)
  collapsibleTitle: "'Rule #' & $string($index + 1)"
```

## Data Sources

Whenever data sources are provided, they are available as corresponding variable names. For more information, see [Configure the dataSources Section](90-datasources.md).

## Examples

- Filtering and displaying APIRUles with the `Error` status.

  ```yaml
  ...
  - name: Failing API Rules
   widget: Table
   source: $root
   targets:
     - slot: details-top
       location: ClusterOverview
     - slot: details-bottom
       location: ClusterOverview
       filter: '$item.status.APIRuleStatus.code="Ok"'
   filter: '$item.status.APIRuleStatus.code="Error"'
   order: 2
   children:
     - name: Name
       source: metadata.name
       widget: Text
     - name: Namespace
       source: metadata.namespace
       widget: Text
     - name: status
       widget: Badge
       highlights:
         positive:
           - 'Ok'
         critical:
           - 'Error'
           - 'Skipped'
       source: 'status.APIRuleStatus.code ? status.APIRuleStatus.code : "Unknown"'
       description: status.APIRuleStatus.desc
  ```

- Counting resource components.

  ```yaml
  ...
  - name: HPAs Statistical Injection Example
     widget: StatisticalCard
     source: status
     mainValue:
       name: Test1
       source: $count($item)
     children:
       - name: Test2
         source: "2"
       - name: Test3
         source: "3"
     targets:
       - location: ClusterOverview
         slot: health
   - name: MyTitle
     widget: RadialChart
     source: "22"
     maxValue: "44"
     color: var(--sapChart_OrderedColor_5)
     targets:
       - slot: health
         location: ClusterOverview
  ```

- Converting String into a readable date.

  ```yaml
  ...
  status:
     header:
       - name: status
         source: 'status.state ? status.state : "UNKNOWN"'
         highlights:
           unknown:
           - UNKNOWN
         widget: Badge
         description: status.message
     body:
       - name: conditions
         source: status.conditions
         widget: ConditionList
       - name: status.expirationDate
         source: '$readableTimestamp(status.expirationDate)'
       - name: issuer
         source: status.issuerRef.name
       - name: Observed Generation
         source: status.observedGeneration
   ...
  ```
