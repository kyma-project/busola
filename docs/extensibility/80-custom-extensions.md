# Custom Extensions

With Busola's custom extension feature, you can design fully custom user interfaces beyond the built-in extensibility functionality. This feature is ideal for creating unique and specialized displays that are not covered by the built-in components.

## Getting Started

To enable the custom extension feature, you must set the corresponding feature flag in your Busola config, which is disabled by default.

```yaml
EXTENSIBILITY_CUSTOM_COMPONENTS:
  isEnabled: true
```

## Creating Custom Extensions

Creating a custom extension is as straightforward as setting up a ConfigMap with the following sections:

- **data.general**: Contains configuration details
- **data.customHtml**: Defines static HTML content
- **data.customScript**: Adds dynamic behavior to your extension.

Once your ConfigMap is ready, add it to your cluster. Then, Busola loads and displays your custom UI.

For more information, see this [example](./../../examples/custom-extension/README.md).
