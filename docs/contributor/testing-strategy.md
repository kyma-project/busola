# Testing Strategy

Each pull request (PR) to the repository triggers CI/CD jobs that verify the Busola configuration, build and run integration tests.

- `Busola Web Build / build-web-image / Build image` - Checks the ESLint code quality and builds the web Docker image.
- `Busola Build / build-busola-image / Build image` - Checks the ESLint code quality and builds the web and backend Docker image.
- `Busola Backend Build / build-backend-image / Build image` - Builds the backend Docker image. The job runs only when changes affect the backend.
- `PR Integration Cluster Tests / run-cluster-test` - Performs integration testing for Busola related to cluster-level functionalities using a k3d cluster.
- `PR Integration Namespace Tests / run-namespace-test` - Performs integration testing for Busola related to namespace-level functionalities using a k3d cluster.
- `PR Kyma Dashboard Integration Tests Dev / run-integration-test` - Performs integration testing for Busola with DEV environement and configuration related to the Kyma functionalities using a k3d cluster with installed Kyma.
- `PR Kyma Dashboard Smoke Tests Stage / run-smoke-test-stage` - Performs smoke testing for Busola with STAGE environement and configuration related to the Kyma functionalities using a k3d cluster with installed Kyma.
- `PR Kyma Dashboard Smoke Tests Prod / run-smoke-test-prod` - Performs smoke testing for Busola with PROD environement and configuration related to the Kyma functionalities using a k3d cluster with installed Kyma.
