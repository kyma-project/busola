While removing, those can be uninstalled together with service catalog

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "styled-components": "^5.2.3",
    "styled-components-grid": "^2.2.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "react-jsonschema-form": "1.7.0"
  }
}
```

There are also references that are not needed anymore in the core-ui:
