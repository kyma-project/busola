# Core UI

## Overview

This project contains an application with the Core UI page for the Kyma Console.

The [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) project provides the structure for this application. Read the project's [documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts) for more information.

## Installation

To install dependencies, run the `npm install` command.

## Usage

Use the following command to build the application in the production environment, in the `build` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

The command allows you to correctly bundle React in the production mode, and optimize the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.

## Development

Run the `npm start` command to start the application in the development mode.
Open the [`http://localhost:8004`](http://localhost:8004) link to view it in the browser.

The page reloads if you make edits.
If lint errors appear, the console displays them.

### Test the application

Run the `npm test` command to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the **npm test** section in the Create React App [documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts#npm-test) for more information.
