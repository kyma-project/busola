# Generic Documentation

## Overview

Generic Documentation is a Busola-dedicated wrapper for the [Documentation Component](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/documentation-component/blob/master/README.md) - a generic, reusable, React set of libraries allowing you to render specifications of these types:

- Markdown
- OpenAPI
- AsyncAPI
- OData

Generic Documentation provides individual layouts for documents and specifications rendered in the Busola under the **docs-ui** (question mark icon on the top navigation panel) and **Service Catalog** views. These layouts are compliant with [Fiori 3 Fundamentals](https://sap.github.io/fundamental/) styling, for example in terms of navigation and tabs. Generic Documentation also downloads specification sources to the Busola from such storage systems as MinIO.
